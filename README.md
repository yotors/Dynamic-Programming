# Knapsack Problem Benchmark

This project benchmarks three different algorithms for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem:

- **Brute Force**
- **Top-Down Dynamic Programming (Memoization)**
- **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (Tabulation)**

The results are visualized and analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Algorithms Overview

- **Brute Force:**  
  Recursively explores all possible subsets of items. Exponential time complexity (O(2^n)). Only practical for very small item counts.

- **Top-Down DP (Memoization):**  
  Uses recursion with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Time complexity is O(n * W), where n is the number of items and W is the knapsack capacity.

- **Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation):**  
  Iteratively builds a DP table. Also O(n * W) time complexity, but generally faster in practice due to iterative structure.

## Results Summary

- **Brute Force** is only feasible for small numbers of items due to exponential growth in computation time.
- **Top-Down DP** is much faster and can handle moderate problem sizes efficiently.
- **Bottom-Up DP** is the most scalable and efficient, especially for larger problem sizes.
